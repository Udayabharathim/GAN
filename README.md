# DigitCrafter: GAN-Based MNIST Digit Generator

> A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that learns to generate realistic handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Built with PyTorch and visualized across epochs.

---

## Overview

**DigitCrafter** is a deep learning project that demonstrates the power of GANs in generating synthetic handwritten digits. The project trains a Generator to produce realistic digit images while a Discriminator tries to distinguish real images from fake ones â€” forming an adversarial setup.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** PyTorch  
- **Dataset:** MNIST (28x28 grayscale digit images)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Torchvision  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Training Format:** Jupyter Notebook / Python Script  

---

## Features

- Implemented custom Generator and Discriminator networks
- Adversarial loss for training GAN
- Saves and visualizes generated digit samples at each epoch
- Lightweight training with customizable number of epochs
- Visualization of progression across epochs (`epoch_1.png`, `epoch_5.png`, ...)

## ðŸ“· Generated Samples

The `samples/` folder contains images generated by the model at different epochs. Here's a visualization comparing outputs over time:

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlibRun Training

Option 1: Using Notebook
Open gan_mnist.ipynb and run all cells.

2: **Using Script**

bash
Copy code
python gan_mnist.py
Check Output Images

Images will be saved in samples/ after each epoch.

A visualization image visualization_across_epochs.png compares generations at selected epochs.

## Results & Observations
The generator improves significantly over 10 epochs.

Generated digits become sharper and more distinguishable over time.

The GAN learns meaningful digit structures even with fewer epochs.
